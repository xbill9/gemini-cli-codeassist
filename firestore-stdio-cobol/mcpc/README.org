mcpc is a <b>M</b>odel <b>C</b>ontext <b>P</b>rotocol library in modern <b>C</b>. Its major goals are:
+ Provide the *most native* bridge between low-level infrastructure
  and AI models
+ Explore the maximum capability of the *most recent* C programming language

* Modern C Support
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: modernc
:END:

Since mcpc claims to implement everything with the most modern C
possible, its building process becomes a little different than many
existing building systems or process, the major
difference is that: **we try to support as many C compilers as possible,
even on one platform**.

Ideally mcpc will be implemented fully in C23(currently the newest
standard), but if a full C23 is missing on a platform, we
either downgrade the C standard, or give up the support.

This approach certainly has some benefits and consequences:

1. The library can launch on as many platforms as possible, and be
   able to compiled by as many C compilers as possible.
2. There must be a minimum fallback version of C standard that the
   library targets, currently it is C11.
3. C23 features that are not patchable, or require non-trivial amount
   of effort to patch, will not be used, e.g., [[https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n2508.pdf][N2508]], [[https://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n2645.pdf][N2645]], etc.
4. All safety checks and performance optimization will only focus on the
   platforms with full C23 support.

* Building
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: building
:END:

** Building (Linux, Cygwin, MSYS2, macOS, etc.)

Prerequisites:
- GNU Make
 
Then
#+begin_src
cd mcpc
make && make tst && make install
#+end_src

** Building (Windows CMD/PS/VS)

Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio
- GNU Make (=winget install ezwinports.make=)

Two options to build:

*** 1. Build in CMD/PS

Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt", then

#+begin_src
cd mcpc
make && make tst
#+end_src

*** 2. Build in Visual Studio:

"File" - "Open" - "CMake", "Build" - "Build All"

#+begin_quote
This approach is only for the better debugging experience on Windows,
/"Build in CMD/PS"/ takes priority over this one.
#+end_quote

** Code Contributing

Despite we claim to use modern C, as standard as possible, and as
modern as possible, we have some extra conventions, in order to render
our code more readable, inclusive and scalable:

1. Unless mentioned explicitly, we follow GNU C [[https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Writing-C.html][coding style]].
2. Prefer functions over macros, use macros only if necessary.
3. The type of variables should be reflected in the source code. Use of
   keyword =auto= is thus forbidden.
4. Names of defined variables that are exposed publicly should be in
   uppercase, otherwise in lowercase.


* FAQ

** Should I prefer mcpc over other SDKs?

It depends on your use case. Roughly speaking, if
1. you prefer your MCP servers or clients to perform tasks in the most
   native way (e.g. manually manage memory allocation, equipped with
   competitive performance, etc.).
2. you wish your MCP servers or clients are distributed with minimum
   software requirements (i.e. you don't want to force users to
   have Python, Node.js or similar things installed on their machines) 
then mcpc is for you. Otherwise I would strongly recommend you consider
Python, Javscript or other SDKs, they have more intuitive and
easy-to-use high-level APIs for MCP protocol.
